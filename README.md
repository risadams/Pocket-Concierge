## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or later
- A home network where you can configure DNS settings

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/risadams/Pocket-Concierge.git
   cd Pocket-Concierge
   ```

2. **Build the application:**

   ```bash

   ```

### Quick Test

Test your DNS server with the included test utility:

```bash
go run test-dns.go laptop.home 127.0.0.1:8053
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Pocket Concierge uses a YAML configuration file. Here's a basic example:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8053
  address: "127.0.0.1"

dns:
  ttl: 300
  enable_recursion: true
  cache_size: 10000
  block_list:
    - "ads.example.com"
    - "tracker.badsite.com"
    - "malware.evil.net"

upstream:
  # DNS-over-HTTPS
  - name: "ControlD DoH Primary"
    address: "dns.controld.com"
    protocol: "https"
    port: 443
    path: "/MY_CTRLD_ENDPOINT_RESOLVER"
    verify: true

  # Fallback DNS
  - name: "Cloudflare"
    address: "1.1.1.1"
    protocol: "udp"
    port: 53
    verify: false

log_level: "info"
home_dns_domain: "home"

hosts:
  - hostname: "laptop"
    ipv4:
      - "192.168.1.101"
    ipv6:
      - "fe80::1234:5678:90ab:cdef"
  
  - hostname: "printer"
    ipv4:
      - "192.168.1.53"
```

### Configuration Options

#### Server Settings

- `server.port`: Port to listen on (default: 8053)
- `server.address`: IP address to bind to (default: 127.0.0.1)

#### DNS Settings

- `dns.ttl`: Default TTL for DNS responses in seconds
- `dns.enable_recursion`: Enable recursive DNS queries
- `dns.cache_size`: Maximum number of cached DNS entries

#### Upstream Servers

Configure multiple upstream DNS servers with different protocols:

- `protocol`: `udp`, `tcp`, `tls`, or `https`
- `verify`: Enable certificate verification for secure protocols
- `path`: Required for DNS-over-HTTPS

#### Local Hosts

- `home_dns_domain`: Default domain suffix for simple hostnames
- `hosts`: Array of local hostname mappings

## 🏠 Home Network Setup

1. **Configure your router** to use Pocket Concierge as the primary DNS server
2. **Set static IP** for the machine running Pocket Concierge
3. **Configure local hostnames** in the config file for your devices
4. **Test connectivity** using the test utility

### Example Home Setup

```yaml
hosts:
  - hostname: "router"
    ipv4: ["192.168.1.1"]
  
  - hostname: "nas"
    ipv4: ["192.168.1.10"]
  
  - hostname: "laptop"
    ipv4: ["192.168.1.100"]
  
  - hostname: "desktop"
    ipv4: ["192.168.1.101"]
  
  - hostname: "phone"
    ipv4: ["192.168.1.150"]
  
  - hostname: "printer"
    ipv4: ["192.168.1.200"]
```

Now you can access your devices using friendly names:

- `http://nas.home` instead of `http://192.168.1.10`
- `ssh user@laptop.home` instead of `ssh user@192.168.1.100`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port 53 already in use**
   - Change the port in config.yaml to something else (e.g., 8053)
   - Stop other DNS services if running on port 53

2. **DNS queries not being resolved**
   - Check that your router/devices are configured to use Pocket Concierge
   - Verify the server is running and listening on the correct port
   - Test with the included test utility

3. **Upstream DNS failures**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify upstream server configurations
   - Try fallback to traditional DNS servers

### Debug Mode

Run with verbose logging:

```yaml
log_level: "debug"
```

### Network Testing

```bash
# Test local resolution
go run test-dns.go laptop.home 127.0.0.1:8053

# Test external resolution
go run test-dns.go google.com 127.0.0.1:8053

# Test IPv6
go run test-dns.go laptop.home 127.0.0.1:8053 AAAA
```
